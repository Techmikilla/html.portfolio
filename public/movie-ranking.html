<h3>Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story</h3>
<p>This is a short series of fiction inspired by facts. It depicts a royal marriage where a queen and king live in separate worlds. Regardless of their differences, they are both still very much in love and willing to support each other. I love this movie because it depicts the meaning of true love and partnership. It is a rollercoaster of emotions, but if you are a fan of hopeless romantics and love i strongly recommend watching this movie.</p>
